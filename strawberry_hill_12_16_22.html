<h2>Math Interventions</h2>
<p>As with the development of reading skills in those with dyslexia, students with math learning differences require tailored instruction to acquire fundamental mathematical skills.</p>
<p>Students also deserve to feel the self-confidence and sense of efficacy that comes with learning these critical skills.</p>
<p>Our team is developing targeted, mathematical interventions based on the dyscalculia subtypes identified by our <a href="/math_battery">UCSF Dyscalculia Subtyping Battery (UCSF-DSB)</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number processing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arithmetic procedures</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arithmetic fact retrieval</strong></li>
<li><strong>Geometrical/Visuospatial abilities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our pilot intervention is going to focus on <strong>arithmetic fact retrieval and reconstruction</strong> based on <strong>multisensory integration</strong>. The goal is to improve children's learning techniques for multiplication tables and help them reconstruct multiplication facts using addition and subtraction strategies.</p>
<p>Beginning with addition and subtraction facts within 20, we are developing a 12-week sequence of lessons designed to be delivered by trained mathematics educators and interventionists.</p>
<p>We will assess the efficacy of our targeted interventions by re-administering the UCSF-DSB to the children in the study.</p>
<p>See some examples below of the materials we are currently developing:</p>
