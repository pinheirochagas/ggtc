I am from SÃ£o Paulo and grew up in state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. I played tennis competitevely during elemenentary and high school, but my joy was always found in the outdoors, hiking the rolling hills of the Atlantic Forrest and Cerrado (tropical savanna). 

I moved to SF 5 years ago from a very bohemian Paris experience and slowly got back into a more active life style9. Through my early runs up to Bernal Heights, I discovered my passion for endurance sports. Around 3 years ago, I had a steep increase in running volume and intensity and ran my first half marathon and marathon. 

To balance my training, I started cycling and swiming in early 2020 I realized that I was already hoocked on the world of Triathlon. I joined GGTC soon after and discover our incredible community of supportive, strong and unique humans. Through the delightfully cold waters and austounsding views of the Bay, San Francisco became my beloved home. 

On the side, I am an Neuroscientist at UCSF with a growing interest in sports science. As part of the 2023 Ambassador's Team, my goal is to support new members in all aspects of their Triathlon jouney and share my fresh but dense experience.
